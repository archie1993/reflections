What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we initialize a repo (repository), there aare no commits.
to initialize a repo, command is : git init.
another command is git status, which shows which all files have changed since last commit.
git log fails when we initialize a repo, it shows an error, so we shud use git status.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is an intermediate stage where all files which we want to commit together are added.
